## Installation

`npm install ftpserver --save`


## Usage

```js
import {FTPServer} from 'ftpserver';
const ftpServer = new FTPServer({...});

ftpServer.listen().then(() => {
  // now listening for connections
});
```

`listen()` to start the server.  
`close()` to stop.

You can pass an object to the constructor to set various options.
Below are the options and their defaults.

```js
var ftpServer = new FTPServer({
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 21,
  pasvStart: null,
  pasvEnd: null,
  timeout: 30000,
  disabledCommands: [],
  anonymous: false,
  logLevel: 10,
  greeting = null,
  override: {
    fs: null,
    authentication: null
  }
});
```

### Options

#### `host` | **String**
IP address clients use to connect to the server.  
This IP will be used for passive connections, so ensure it is your remote IP.

#### `port` | **Integer**
Port clients use to connect to the server.

#### `pasvStart` / `pasvEnd` | **Integer**
Sets the range for ports to use with a passive connection.  
The server will have the client connect to the first available port within the range.

#### `timeout` | **Integer**
How long (*in milliseconds*) before a connection is closed if no commands are received.

#### `disabledCommands` | **Array [String]**
String array of client commands that are forbidden.  
These commands will be replied to with code 502.  
**Example**: `disabledCommands: ['RMD', 'RNFR', 'RNTO']`

#### `anonymous` | **Boolean**
If true, will not authenticate connections and will act as if all connections are authenticated.

#### `logLevel` | **Integer**
See [Bunyan Levels](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan#levels).

#### `greeting` | **String**
If set, a greeting is sent to the connection when it first connects.  
This can be a string or path to a file.

#### `override` | **Object**
Used to override various functions or classes.  
See [Override Section](#override).


## Features

### Classes

#### `File`

The [File](https://github.com/stewarttylerr/ftpserver/blob/master/lib/ftp/file.js)
class is used to signify a file or directory.

```js
import fs from 'fs';
import {File} from 'FTPServer';

fs.stat(..., (stat) {
  let myFile = new File('/path/to/file/or/directory').fromStat(stat);
});
```

You can use the `fromStat` function to populate information on the file or directory
from the `fs` `stat` function.

### Override

#### `authentication`
You can override the default authentication function used by connections.

```js
function myAuthFunction(username, password) {
  ...
}

new FTPServer({
  ...
  override: {
    authentication: myAuthFunction
  }
})
```

Your function must return a promise that resolves if sucessful, and rejects otherwise.

> **ACCT:**  
> If your connections require an account (ACCT), resolve your function with `332`.  
(This is not implemented yet)

#### `fs`
You can override the default filesystem the server uses by creating a
new filesystem class.  
Doing so can allow you to interact directly with the data without any
real file access.
```js
class MyFileSystem {
  constructor() {
    // Current connection: this.connection
    // Bunyan logger: this.connection.bunyan
  }
  ...
}

...

new FTPServer({
  ...
  override: {
    fs: MyFileSystem
  }
});
```

When a connection is recieved it will call `new` on the overridden class.
The current connection will be available with `this.connection`.

##### Functions
The following functions are to be implemented in your class and must
return promises (check `lib/ftp/file-system.js` for examples):

```js
list(dir) {}
```
> Receives a path to a directory relative to the current directory.  
If no argument, than the current directory is used.  
Returns an array of `File` classes (see [File Section](#file-class))

```js
write(filePath, append) {}
```
> Receives the relative path to write a new file.  
Returns the stream to write data to.

```js
read(filePath) {}
```
> Receives the relative path to a file to read it's contents.  
Returns the stream to read data from.

```js
get(path)  {}
```
> Returns a `File` class to the path (either a file or directory).

```js
chdir(dir) {}
```
> Change the current directory (dir is relative).

```js
mkdir(dir) {}
```
> Create a directory relative to the current directory.

```js
delete(filePath) {}
```
> Delete a file or directory relative to the current directory.

```js
rename(oldName, newName) {}
```
> Rename a file or directory relative to the current directory.
